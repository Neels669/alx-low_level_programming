**0x02-functions_nested_loops**

This project aims to learn the below:

* Nested loops and how to use them.
* Functions and how to use them.
* Prototypes.
* Scope of variables.
* Header files and how to use them.
* Note: The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function _putchar is included in the header file called main.h ~ You have to start by creating your main.h
* main.h is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.

**TASKS**

* 0-putchar
Program that prints "_putchar", followed by a new line.

* 1-alphabet
Function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);

You can only use _putchar twice in your code.

* 2-print_alphabet_x10
Function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);

You can only use _putchar twice in your code

* 3-islower
Function that checks for lowercase character.

Prototype: int _islower(int c);

Returns 1 if c is lowercase, returns 0 otherwise.

* 4-isalpha
Function that checks for alphabetic character.

Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);

Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase; Returns 0 otherwise.

* 5-sign
Function that prints the sign of a number.

Prototype: int print_sign(int n);

Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero; Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero; Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero.

* 6-abs
Function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

Prototype: int _abs(int);

* 7-print_last_digit
Function that prints the last digit of a number.

Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);

Returns the value of the last digit

* 8-24_hours
Function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);

* 9-times_table
Function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

Prototype: void times_table(void)

* 10-add
Function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Prototype: int add(int, int);

* 11-print_98
Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);

Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space

Numbers should be printed in order

The first printed number should be the number passed to your function

The last printed number should be 98

You are allowed to use the standard library
