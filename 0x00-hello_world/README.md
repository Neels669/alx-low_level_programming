Task 0 - (0-preprocessor) - Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output should be saved in the file c.

Task 1 - (1-compiler) - Script that compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.

Task 2 - (2-assembler) - Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

Task 3 - (3-name) - Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.

Task 4 - (4-puts.c) - C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. Use the function puts. Program should end with the value 0. 
puts() function only permits you to print a string only to your screen.

Task 5 - (5-printf.c) - C program that prints exactly (with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,) this is followed by a new line. Function printf is used. The program should return 0. 
printf() function is used to print both strings and variables to the screen, in this task it is used for printing string.

Task 6 - (6-size.c) - C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. Program should return 0. 

Task 7 - (100-intel) - Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

Task 8 - (101-quote.c) - C program that prints exactly (and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19) followed by a new line, to the standard error. You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts. Your program should return 1.
