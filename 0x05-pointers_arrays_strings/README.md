This project aims to learn the below:

Pointers and how to use them.

Arrays and how to use them.

Differences between pointers and arrays.

How to use strings and how to manipulate them.

Note: The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function _putchar is included in the header file called main.h ~ You have to start by creating your main.h

main.h is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.
