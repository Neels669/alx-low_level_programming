**0x08. C - Recursion**

This project aims to learn the below:

Recursions.

Implementing Recursions. Situations you should implement recursion and situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion.

Note: The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function _putchar is included in the header file called main.h ~ You have to start by creating your main.h

Not allowed to use any kind of loops AND Static Variables.

main.h is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.

**TASKS**

* 0-puts_recursion.c

Function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

* 1-print_rev_recursion.c

Function that prints a string in reverse.

Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

* 2-strlen_recursion.c

Function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

* 3-factorial.c

Function that returns the factorial of a given number.

Prototype: int factorial(int n);

If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error. Factorial of 0 is 1.

* 4-pow_recursion.c

Function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);

If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

* 5-sqrt_recursion.c

Function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);

If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1

* 6-is_prime_number.c

Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);
