**0x0F. C - Function pointers**

This project aims to learn the below:

What are function pointers and how to use them.

What does a function pointer exactly hold.

Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory.

Note: The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function _putchar is included in the header file called function_pointers.h ~ You have to start by creating your function_pointers.h which should be include guarded. 

**TASKS**

* 0-print_name.c

Function that prints a name.

Prototype: void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));

* 1-array_iterator.c

Function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

Prototype: void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));

where size is the size of the array and action is a pointer to the function you need to use.

* 2-int_index.c

Function that searches for an integer.

Prototype: int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));

where size is the number of elements in the array array

cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values

int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0

If no element matches, return -1

If size <= 0, return -1

* 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h

Program that performs simple operations.

You are allowed to use the standard library

Usage: calc num1 operator num2

You can assume num1 and num2 are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to int

operator is one of the following:

+: addition

-: subtraction

*: multiplication

/: division

%: modulo

The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line

You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an int

if the number of arguments is wrong, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 98

if the operator is none of the above, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 99

if the user tries to divide (/ or %) by 0, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 100

* 3-op_functions.c

This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):

op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);

op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);

op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);

op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);

op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);

* 3-get_op_func.c

This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. Youâ€™re not allowed to declare any other function.

Prototype: int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int);

where s is the operator passed as argument to the program

This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: get_op_func("+") should return a pointer to the function op_add

If s does not match any of the 5 expected operators (+, -, *, /, %), return NULL

* 3-main.c

This file should contain your main function only.

You are not allowed to directly call op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div or op_mod from the main function

You have to use atoi to convert arguments to int

You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 if statements.
