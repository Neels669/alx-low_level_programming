This project aims to learn the below:
- Using arithmetic operators
- Using Boolean / logical operators
- Using If.. Else Statements
- Declaring variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- Using the while loop
- Usng the the ASCII character set

**TASKS**

* 0-positive_or_negative

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. 

The output of the program should be: 

The number, followed by if the number is greater than 0: is positive if the number is 0: is zero if the number is less than 0: is negative followed by a new line


* 1-last_digit

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

The output of the program should be:

The string "Last digit of," followed by n, followed by the string "is," followed by if n is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5" if n is 0: the string "and is 0" if n is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0" followed by a new line.
